# Blog Client

- Client for a blog API
- built with react, reeact router

### Learned

- to use google as auth, the client need to come from the origin server to pass the jwt, unable to send cookies cross origin
- The importance of using state management for things such as user auth, being able to manipulate and access state from any component makes things much easier
